approx.conf:
	Configuration file to be used by approx. Make sure repositories listed match
	what nodes require (and what is used in node-sources).

	Default settings match Ubuntu 15.10 for Odroid XU4, will probably also work
	for other Ubuntu devices but it is untested.
	For more details, see ´man approx´ and ´man approx.conf´.

node-sources:
	What will be used as /etc/apt/sources-list on nodes. Set up sources to match
	what is provided by approx.conf. E.g.

	deb http://master:9999/ubuntu-node/ vivid main universe restricted
	
	Default settings match Ubuntu 15.10 for Odroid XU4.
